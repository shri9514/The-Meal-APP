# The Meal App 
The Meal App is a website where you can find recipes easily. It uses a special tool to look up recipes from a big recipe database. You can search for a recipe, see all the ingredients and how to make it, and even check how healthy it is. You can also save your favorite recipes to find them later. This project shows that the creator is good at making websites, using a simple kind of code called vanilla JavaScript, which makes the website work well and fast. It's a great thing to have in their work portfolio to show they can make a website all by themselves.
